# movie recommendation system

• Built a movie recommendation system in Python, based on Collaborative Filtering by applying Matrix Factorization
• Initialized the matrix factorization model and trained and optimized the model for enhanced performance in the system
• Extracted embeddings from each movie, then applied K-Means clustering to effectively group movies based on these embeddings
